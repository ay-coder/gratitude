        <strong> What is Gratitude Circle? </strong>
<p>
Gratitude Circle&trade; is a unique, fun and interactive social media app which empowers users by encouraging them to share gratitude and feel the benefits of doing so!  The app is unique because it compiles photo and note posts in one ‘Feed’ for you to soak up gratefulness shared within the circle you set up.  The app aims to bring happiness and positivity to its users.  Add or invite friends to begin.  You can react to others’ posts with a ‘Like’ and or ‘Love’ button and discover newly inspiring ways to pay it forward.  You can privately track gratitude in ‘My Notebook’ as well.  Feel free to express gratitude with close or wide circles of friends, family, co-workers, neighbors, mentors, acquaintances and more by also trying the ‘Group’ feature.   Gratitude Circle’s user empowerment via gratitude definitely makes it “social media you’ll want to keep.”  Empower yourself today!
