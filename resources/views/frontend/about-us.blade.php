        <strong> What is Gratitude Circle? </strong>
<p>
Gratitude CircleTM is a unique, fun and interactive social media app which empowers users by encouraging them to share gratitude and feel the benefits of doing so!  The app is unique because it compiles photo and note posts in one ‘Feed’ for you to soak up gratefulness shared within the circle you set up.  The app aims to bring happiness and positivity to its users.  Add or invite friends to begin.  You can react to others’ posts with a ‘Like’ and or ‘Love’ button and discover newly inspiring ways to pay it forward.  You can privately track gratitude in ‘My Notebook’ as well.  Feel free to express gratitude with close or wide circles of friends, family, co-workers, neighbors, mentors, acquaintances and more by also trying the ‘Group’ feature.   Gratitude Circle’s user empowerment via gratitude definitely makes it “social media you’ll want to keep.”  Empower yourself today!

<strong>Why post on your friends Gratitude page?</strong>
<p>
Because now you can take all the messages, funny photos or videos and any jokes or content you decided is relevant to a friend and post it onto their page! That way their friends get to see the content posted. For example, all those Happy Birthday/congratulations or even more thoughtful serious messages can appropriately be posted onto your friends page so the friends of your friend (who’s page you’re posting onto get to see the post). In other words, people who actually care about the person you’re posting about.

<strong>Why is posting on Gratitude way more fun, unique 
and effective than anything else?</strong>
<p>
Because when posting on to your friends Gratitude page you get to connect with new people, bond with mutual friends and post photos or videos directly on to your friends page, where it is more relevant. Most importantly, since there is only a view counter and comment section on each post, so their is not judgement in terms of likes, and since each post will be on your friends page (if they approve of the post) there is no need to worry about being judged for the post.
